# README: Used Car Pricing Analysis

## **Overview**
This files provides an analysis of used car pricing using Linear and Lasso Regression models. The goal is to identify the key factors influencing vehicle prices and help used car dealers make data-driven decisions for inventory selection and pricing strategies.

## **Key Findings**
### **Factors That Increase Car Prices:**
1. **Cylinders**: More cylinders correlate with higher prices (+$2,796 per cylinder).
2. **Vehicle Type**: Trucks (+$1,819), Pickups (+$942), and Full/Mid-size vehicles have higher value.
3. **Transmission**: Manual transmissions add ~$473 to the price.
4. **Luxury Brands**: Tesla (+$469), Porsche (+$464), and Lexus (+$388) retain higher resale value.
5. **Convertibles**: Priced higher (+$389) due to niche demand.

### **Factors That Decrease Car Prices:**
1. **Car Age**: Depreciates significantly (-$4,780 per year).
2. **Mileage**: Higher odometer readings lower price (-$2,867 per 10,000 miles).
3. **Fuel Type**: Gasoline (-$2,509) and Hybrid (-$1,165) vehicles have lower resale value.
4. **Drive Type**: FWD vehicles (-$1,121) are priced lower than AWD/RWD models.
5. **Mass-Market Brands**: Nissan (-$1,094), Ford (-$1,070), and Chevrolet (-$895) have lower values.
6. **Rebuilt Title**: Prior damage history reduces price (-$840).

## **Business Implications**
- **Stock high-value vehicles**: Trucks, full-size cars, and luxury brands yield higher resale values.
- **Competitive pricing for older & high-mileage vehicles**: Adjust pricing strategies accordingly.
- **Monitor market trends**: Consider demand shifts, especially in electric and AWD vehicles.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Refine pricing models** using advanced machine learning techniques.
2. **Optimize inventory** to focus on high-value vehicle types.
3. **Adapt to emerging trends** like EV adoption and seasonal pricing variations.
